            <p>Star Wars is an American epic space-opera multimedia franchise created by George Lucas, which began with
                the eponymous 1977 film and quickly became a worldwide pop-culture phenomenon.<br>
                The franchise has been expanded into various films and other media, including television series, video
                games, novels, comic books, theme park attractions, and themed areas, comprising an all-encompassing
                fictional universe.<br>
                In 2020, its total value was estimated at US$70 billion, and it is currently the fifth-highest-grossing
                media franchise of all time.</p><br>

                <p>In 2012, Lucas sold his production company to Disney, relinquishing his ownership of the franchise.
                </p><br>

                <p>This led to a sequel trilogy, consisting of:

                <li><em>Solo (2018).</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>The combined box office revenue of the films equated to over US$10 billion, which makes it the
                second-highest-grossing film franchise of all time.<br>
                An additional film, Rogue Squadron, is planned for December 22, 2023 release. <br>
                A number of other films,

            <p>The Star Wars franchise depicts the adventures of characters <b>"A long time ago in a galaxy far, far
                    away"</b>, in which humans and many species of aliens (often humanoid) co-exist with robots
                (typically referred to in the films as 'droids'), who may assist them in their daily routines; space
                travel between planets is common due to lightspeed hyperspace technology. <br>
                Spacecraft range from small starfighters, to huge capital ships such as the Star Destroyers, to space
                stations such as the moon-sized Death Stars. Telecommunication includes two-way audio and audiovisual
                screens, and holographic projections.

                <br><br>A mystical power known as the Force is described in the original film as "an energy field
                created by all living things ... [that] binds the galaxy together". Through training and meditation,
                those whom <b>"the Force is strong with"</b> are able to perform various superpowers (such as
                telekinesis, precognition, telepathy, and manipulation of physical energy). <br><br>
                The Force is wielded by two major knightly orders at conflict with each other:
            </p>
            <ul>

                <li><b>the Jedi</b></a>, peacekeepers of the Galactic Republic who act on the light side of the Force
                    through
                    non-attachment and arbitration,</li>
                <li><strong>and the Sith</strong>, who use the dark side by manipulating fear and aggression.</li>
            </ul>

            <a class="a" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Code_of_the_Sith/Legends">Sith Code</a><br>

            <a class="a_2" href="https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki/Jedi_Code">Jedi Code</a>

            <p>While <b>Jedi Knights</b> can be numerous, the <strong>Dark Lords of the Sith (or 'Darths')</strong> are
                intended to be limited to two: <strong>a master and their apprentice.</strong></p>

            <p>Force-wielders are very limited in numbers in comparison to the population. The Jedi and Sith prefer the
                use
                of a weapon called a lightsaber, a blade of energy that can cut through virtually any surface and
                deflect
                energy bolts. The rest of the population, as well as renegades and soldiers, use laser-powered blaster
                firearms. In the outer reaches of the galaxy, crime syndicates such as the Hutt cartel are dominant.
                Bounty
                hunters are often employed by both gangsters and governments. Illicit activities include smuggling and
                slavery.</p>

                <h2 id="2">The Skywalker Saga (Original trilogy)</h2>
            </div>

            <p>The original trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Mark Hamill (Luke Skywalker), Harrison
                Ford (Han Solo), Carrie Fisher (Princess Leia), and James Earl Jones (Darth Vader's voice).
                In 1971, George Lucas wanted to film an adaptation of the Flash Gordon serial, but could not obtain the
                rights, so he began developing his own space opera.<br>After directing American Graffiti (1973), he
                wrote a two-page synopsis, which 20th Century Fox decided to invest in. By 1974, he had expanded the
                story into the first draft of a screenplay. The 1977 movie's success led Lucas to make it the basis of
                an elaborate film serial. With the backstory he created for the sequel, Lucas decided that the series
                would be a trilogy of trilogies. Most of the main cast would return for the two additional installments
                of the original trilogy, which were self-financed by Lucasfilm.<br>

                Star Wars was released on May 25, 1977, and first subtitled <em>Episode IV: A New Hope</em> in the 1979
                book The
                Art of Star Wars. <em>Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back</em> was released on May 21, 1980, also
                achieving
                wide financial and critical success. The final film in the trilogy, <em>Episode VI: Return of the
                    Jedi</em> was
                released on May 25, 1983. The story of the original trilogy focuses on Luke Skywalker's quest to become
                a Jedi, his struggle with the evil Imperial agent Darth Vader, and the struggle of the Rebel Alliance to
                free the galaxy from the clutches of the Galactic Empire.</p>

            <div class="h">
                <h2 id="3">Prequel trilogy</h2>
            </div>

            <p>The prequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Ewan McGregor (Obi-Wan Kenobi), Natalie
                Portman (Padm√© Amidala), Hayden Christensen (Anakin Skywalker),[e] and Ian McDiarmid (Palpatine).
                According to producer Gary Kurtz, loose plans for a prequel trilogy were developed during the outlining
                of the original two films. In 1980, Lucas confirmed that he had the nine-film series plotted, but due to
                the stress of producing the original trilogy, he had decided to cancel further sequels by 1981. In 1983,
                Lucas explained that "There was never a script completed that had the entire story as it exists now ...
                As the stories unfolded, I would take certain ideas and save them ... I kept taking out all the good
                parts, and I just kept telling myself I would make other movies someday."<br>

                Technical advances in the late 1980s and early 1990s, including the ability to create computer-generated
                imagery (CGI), inspired Lucas to consider that it might be possible to revisit his saga. In 1989, Lucas
                stated that the prequels would be "unbelievably expensive." In 1992, he acknowledged that he had plans
                to create the prequel trilogy. A theatrical rerelease of the original trilogy in 1997 "updated" the
                20-year-old films with the style of CGI envisioned for the new trilogy.<br>

                <em>Episode I: The Phantom Menace</em> was released on May 19, 1999, and <em>Episode II: Attack of the
                    Clones</em> on May
                16, 2002. <em>Episode III: Revenge of the Sith</em>, the first PG-13 film in the franchise, was released
                on May
                19, 2005. The first two movies were met with mixed reviews, with the third being received somewhat more
                positively. The trilogy begins 32 years before Episode IV and follows the Jedi training of Anakin
                Skywalker, Luke's father, and his eventual fall from grace and transformation into the Sith lord Darth
                Vader, as well as the corruption of the Galactic Republic and rise of the Empire led by Darth Sidious.
                Together with the original trilogy, Lucas has collectively referred to the first six episodic films of
                the franchise as "the tragedy of Darth Vader".<br>

                <h2 id="4">Sequel trilogy</h2>
            </div>

            <p>The sequel trilogy's main cast includes (from left to right) Adam Driver (Kylo Ren), Daisy Ridley (Rey),
                John Boyega (Finn), and Oscar Isaac (Poe Dameron).
                Prior to releasing the original film, and made possible by its success, Lucas planned "three trilogies
                of
                nine films." He announced this to Time in 1978, and confirmed that he had outlined them in 1981. At
                various
                stages of development, the sequel trilogy was to focus on the rebuilding of the Republic, the return of
                Luke
                in a role similar to that of Obi-Wan in the original trilogy, Luke's sister (not yet determined to
                be
                Leia), Han, Leia, R2-D2 and C-3PO.<br> However, after beginning work on the prequel trilogy, Lucas
                insisted
                that
                Star Wars was meant to be a six-part series and that there would be no sequel trilogy.

                Lucas decided to leave the franchise in the hands of other filmmakers, announcing in January 2012 that
                he
                would make no more Star Wars films. That October, the Walt Disney Company agreed to buy Lucasfilm and
                announced that Episode VII would be released in 2015. The co-chairman of Lucasfilm, Kathleen Kennedy,
                became
                president and served as executive producer of new Star Wars feature films. Lucas provided Kennedy his
                story
                treatments for the sequels during the 2012 sale, but in 2015 it was revealed Lucas's sequel outline had
                been
                discarded. The sequel trilogy also meant the end of the existing Star Wars Expanded Universe, which was
                discarded from canon to give "maximum creative freedom to the filmmakers and also preserve an element of
                surprise and discovery for the audience."

                <em>Episode VII: The Force Awakens</em> was released on December 16, 2015, <em>Episode VIII: The Last
                    Jedi</em> on
                December
                13, 2017, and <em>Episode IX: The Rise of Skywalker</em> on December 18, 2019, in many countries.The
                Force
                Awakens
                and The Last Jedi were both critical and box office successes. Episode IX received a mixed reception
                from
                critics and audiences. The sequel trilogy starts 30 years after Episode VI and focuses on the journey of
                the
                Force-sensitive orphan Rey, guided by Luke Skywalker. Along with ex-stormtrooper Finn and ace X-Wing
                pilot
                Poe Dameron, Rey helps the Resistance, led by Leia, fight the First Order, commanded by Han and Leia's
                son
                (and Luke's nephew), Kylo Ren.

                series (though the word anthology has not been used in any of the titles, instead carrying the
                promotional "A Star Wars Story" subtitle). Focused on how the Rebels obtained the Death Star plans
                introduced in the 1977 film, the first anthology film, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story, was released on
                December 16, 2016, to favorable reviews and box office success. The second, <em>Solo: A Star Wars
                    Story</em>,
                centered on a young Han Solo with Chewbacca and Lando as supporting characters, was released on May 25,
                2018, to generally favorable reviews and underperformance at the box office. The television series
                Obi-Wan
                Kenobi was originally going to be a film instead but changed to a limited series due to Solo
                bombing.
                Despite this, more anthology films are expected to be released, following a hiatus after 2019's The
                Rise
                of Skywalker. The next film will be <em>Rogue Squadron</em> in December 2023.</p>
